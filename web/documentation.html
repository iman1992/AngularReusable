Mechanisms for reuse in Java.

In Java, reuse can be done in a lot of different ways, depending on your definition of reuse. In some ways objects can be considered a reusable container, DTO's as well. Reuse is probably more purely used when talking about things like superclasses and subclasses though, as a subclass reuses all inherent functionality and values in a superclass. 

Mechanisms for reuse in AngularJS

Reuse in AngularJS would encapsulate stuff like factories, filters, directives and the like, as they provide a way to much more flexibly and quickly reuse specific functionality and values without having to define and provide the same values and information in several different controllers.

How to implement reusable components in AngularJS

Factories can be used by calling on the factory's name, and then the functions within that factory. Directives are implemented through using the tag defined as the directives name in HTML. Filters are implemented when calling for variables in the Angular controller in use.
